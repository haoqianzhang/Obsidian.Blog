# Obsidian Blog

This is a _non-profitable_ platform for blogs built on **EOS**. It makes use of the _decentralized_ features from **EOS**, as well as the _scalability_ of it. As a result, many people can use this platform to write their blogs. 

The freedom of speech is also guaranteed here, where speech is unable to be filtered on this platform, and the history of the blogs’ contents would be _unchangeable_, disallowing erasing of blogs’ content by the authorities. 

We believe that only by using **EOS**, people will be encouraged to express their opinions freely without any concerns.
