It was a cold December afternoon, and my best friend, Stephanie, and I had procured some acid. We had decided we deserved some fun after finishing the fall semester of our senior year in college. Since my boyfriend, Chris, was uncomfortable with me going out at night (“too pretty,” “can’t trust other men”), we had to get creative. We decided to trip for the first time before I headed home to San Francisco to continue on in my tech internship.\n\n\
\
I hated the internship. I had done it all summer, and it was a Good Gig. It paid well, I met “decision makers” in the tech industry, and I liked the feeling of important people checking me out as I walked to work in my pencil skirts every day.\n\n\
\
But it was a summer of sending emails that went ignored, staying silent in meetings, coming up with creative excuses for why I couldn’t make company happy hour, forcing awkward conversation with my co-workers, feeling dumb about literally everything, and staring at the clock until 6 p.m. There were no official hours, and most people stayed coding until 9 or 10. All of our meals were catered; there was a ping-pong table; we were “on the brink of disrupting an industry.” Why would you ever leave?\n\n\
\
Six p.m. was the longest I could be there without wanting to crawl out of my skin.\n\n\
\
Then I would take the bus home (a 90-minute commute), eat dinner, and try to stay awake through an episode of TV but would usually doze off before 9 p.m., and then wake up to do The Thing all over again. That was my life in summer, and that would be my life during winter break.\n\n\
\
I was a senior — too late to switch majors or career tracks. This was my sneak peek into what my life would look like, come graduation in May. If this degree granted me that job, what was the point? Is this what life was? This new kind of exhaustion, the kind of tiredness that sinks into your bones? When the week wears you down so much that you don’t even want to leave your house on the weekend because you’re so tired? Then, when you do, you spend lavish amounts of money, lamenting how “this makes it all worth it”?\n\n\
\
If this was what my college degree granted me, I didn’t want it.\n\n\
\
“How did your final go?” Stephanie asked when she picked me up from campus in her blue Ford Focus, the back seat filled with art supplies, books, and snacks — supplies for our trippy day in the park.\n\n\
\
“Awful,” I admitted. “I didn’t even answer the last 10 questions. I’m just done.”\n\n\
\
She turned up Nirvana’s Unplugged album, and I was grateful for it. “I don’t want to go back there,” I told her, once I could find the words.\n\n\
\
“Why don’t you quit?” she asked, “There are other jobs.”\n\n\
\
“This is my degree,” I said. “This is, like, the best it’s gonna get. It’s such a good opportunity. This is what these kind of jobs are like. And my mom said they have good benefits, post-grad.”\n\n\
\
“You’re a good writer. You should find a writing job.”\n\n\
\
The me who enjoyed writing seemed so detached from my being. That girl didn’t exist in “adulthood” reality. You couldn’t just be a writer. Reality was long commutes, passionless days, tasteless food. That was responsibility; that was adulthood. I had tasted it this summer, and I wanted to vomit it back up.\n\n\
\
I could just get married to Chris. I could get up early to make him eggs, kiss him goodbye as he went to the office. I could have no other tasks but to cook for him, clean for him, love him. I could take up Pilates or yoga so I could stay hot for him. I’d drink green juice and spend my days shopping, lunching with friends, gossiping about reality television stars. I glanced at our acid supplies in the back seat — maybe I’d take up painting like Stephanie.\n\n\
\
This vision offered equal amounts solace and sadness. I couldn’t imagine staying home all day would be fulfilling. But it was also reassuring to know I was a pretty girl, so I could find some guy to take care of me if making my own money depressed me too much. Chris and his engineering job would certainly fit the bill.\n\n\
\
Stephanie and I chose Balboa Park as our place to trip, on the premise that it had nature, which was apparently enjoyable while tripping. We arrived and placed the tabs on our tongues. For the first hour, nothing happened. I put on an extra sweater. Stephanie read. I became transfixed by a leaf shaking in the wind. Then I realized that rather than shaking, it was taking on a life of its own — it was breathing. Which leaves don’t normally do. I concluded that I was tripping.\n\n\
\
Stephanie and I flopped on the grass and giggled together about absolutely nothing. We marveled at the fractals the leaves created, how all the nature around us felt like living, breathing, sentient beings. She painted, and I listened to a Tame Impala album, blissfully surfing on the melodies and lyrics. It felt like I was downloading this very album to my soul. I took the speaker with me and began to walk around the park.\n\n\
\
A flower garden caught my eye. I plopped down in front of a particularly enticing lilac and stared at her, immersed in her fractals, the way sacred geometry spat out from her petals, until she and I were one. I saw her beauty and her uselessness. I understood her completely.'
