        title: 'Liu Xiaobo, Nobel laureate and political prisoner, dies at 61 in Chinese custody',
        subtitle: 'Peace prize winner and democracy activist dies of liver cancer, after spending almost a quarter of his life behind bars in China',
        content: 'China is facing a barrage of international criticism for its treatment of the Nobel laureate and democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo, who died at the age of 61 on Thursday.\n\nLiu, who championed non-violent resistance as a way of overcoming “forceful tyranny”, had been serving an 11-year jail sentence for demanding an end to one-party rule when he was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer in May.\n\nHe died of multiple organ failure while under guard at a hospital in north-east China, making him the first Nobel peace prize winner to die in custody since German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, the 1935 recipient, who died under surveillance after years confined to Nazi concentration camps.\n\nNews of Liu’s death sparked an immediate outpouring of international mourning and condemnation. His peaceful activism and biting criticism of one-party rule meant he had spent almost a quarter of his life behind bars.\n\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, paid tribute to “a courageous fighter for civil rights and freedom of opinion”.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said he mourned the loss of a man who had dedicated “his life to the betterment of his country and humankind, and to the pursuit of justice and liberty”.\n\nThe leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize, said the Chinese government – which had stopped Liu travelling abroad for treatment despite appeals from world leaders – bore “a heavy responsibility for his premature death”.\n\n“We find it deeply disturbing that Liu Xiaobo was not transferred to a facility where he could receive adequate medical treatment before he became terminally ill,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen.\n\nThe British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he was deeply saddened by the “huge loss” of the “lifelong campaigner for democracy, human rights and peace” and attacked Beijing for denying Liu and his family the chance to seek medical treatment overseas.\n\n“Liu Xiaobo should have been allowed to choose his own medical treatment overseas, which the Chinese authorities repeatedly denied him. This was wrong and I now urge them to lift all restrictions on his widow, Liu Xia.”\n\nOne of the most forceful attacks on the authoritarian regime of China’s president, Xi Jinping, came from his Taiwanese counterpart, Tsai Ing-wen, who paid tribute to a “human rights warrior”.\n\nTsai said Liu had striven to transform China into a nation where human rights and the rule of law were respected. “This was Liu Xiaobo’s Chinese dream,” Tsai said, alluding to Xi’s central propaganda slogan.\n\n“We hope that the Chinese authorities can show confidence in engaging in political reform so that the Chinese people can enjoy the God-given rights of freedom and democracy … Only through democracy, in which every Chinese person has freedom and respect, can China truly become a proud and important country.”\n\nLiu Xiaobo was famed for his Gandhian “no enemies” philosophy – but there was rage as well as grief among his friends as news of his death spread.\n\n\n“I hate this government,” said the author and activist Tienchi Martin-Liao, breaking down in tears as she learned of her friend’s death. “It is not only sadness – it is fury. How can a regime treat a person like Liu Xiaobo like this?\n\n“This is unbearable. This will go down in history. No one should forget what this government and the Xi Jinping administration has done. It is unforgivable.”\n\nThe writer and activist Mo Zhixu, said he felt “bitter hatred”. “It is so cruel and inhuman.”\n\nHu Ping, a friend of almost three decades who edits a pro-democracy journal called the Beijing Spring, said: “Liu Xiaobo is immortal, no matter whether he is alive or dead. Liu Xiaobo is a man of greatness, a saint.”\n\nHu said his friend’s plight highlighted the bleak realities facing activists living under Xi, who has presided over what observers call the most severe political chill since the days following the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.\n\n“I think the situation in China now is deteriorating – and the way in which Liu has been treated clearly shows us what the current situation is, and how it goes beyond our imagination.”\n\nBorn in the northern province of Jilin in 1955, Liu was part of the first generation of Chinese students to go to university after they reopened following the upheaval of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. He studied Chinese literature and went on to become a revered writer and public intellectual.\n\nWhen pro-democracy protests broke out in Beijing in the spring of 1989, Liu was lecturing in New York but decided to return despite having previously shown little interest in politics.\n\n“He thought: ‘This is where I should be and this is where I can make a contribution. So I am going there’,” said Perry Link, a Chinese literature expert from the University of California, Riverside, who knew him.\n\nLiu flew back to Beijing and headed to Tiananmen Square, where he played a central role in the protests. He led a hunger strike shortly before the 4 June military crackdown in which hundreds, possibly thousands of lives were lost. He was jailed for almost two years for his role in what Beijing called “counter-revolutionary” riots. The experience served as a political awakening that transformed Liu into a lifelong activist and champion of democracy.\n\nOver the coming years Liu continued to speak out, despite two more stints behind bars, railing incessantly against China’s authoritarian regime in essays and interviews.\n\nThe “crime” that led to Liu spending his final years behind bars was Charter 08, a 2008 declaration inspired by Charter 77, a manifesto published by Czechoslovakian dissidents in 1977. “The current system has become backward to the point that change cannot be avoided,” it warned, calling for an end to one-party rule.\n\nAuthorities did not approve. Hours before it was due to be published, Liu, who had been one of the document’s drafters, was detained at his Beijing home. The following year he was handed an 11-year sentence for “inciting subversion of state power”.\n\n“The charter was the first public document since 1949 to dare to mention the end of one-party rule,” said Link. “But of course the problem with having an influence is that the crackdown has been effective. A lot of young people don’t know about the charter and don’t know about Liu Xiaobo now.”\n\nIn 2010, Liu was awarded the Nobel peace prize for his “long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China”. He was represented at the award ceremony by an empty chair. When he was informed of his victory he reportedly said: “I dedicate this prize to the lost souls of 4 June,” in reference to the victims of the Tiananmen massacre.\n\nHuman rights and democracy campaigners saw Liu’s Nobel prize as a triumph for their cause. But for his wife, the poet and artist Liu Xia, with whom he had fallen in love during the 1990s, it was a catastrophe. She was immediately placed under house arrest and has spent recent years living in almost total isolation, under constant surveillance.\n\n“She is a wonderful woman. A really wonderful woman,” says Jean-Philippe Béja, a French academic and longstanding friend. “I don’t even dare to imagine how she feels now.”\n\nEva Pils, an expert in Chinese law and human rights from King’s College London, said Liu Xiaobo would be remembered for his “wise and forceful” style of political resistance. Supporters had been counting the days until his expected release from prison in 2019. “Now this is extremely disappointing,” she said. “Naturally, I, like many others, had been counting down to the time of his release. It’s so unfair.”\n\nLink said Liu would be remembered as “a stubborn truth-teller” and someone who opened “the possibility of a different kind of China”.\n\n“That is a lasting legacy. The model of how an independent intellectual stands up to the state will be admired if it is not completely obliterated.”\n\nBéja said Liu’s ideas would continue to inspire, long after his death. “It’s always very hard to evaluate the impact of a thinker or of an actor but I am sure that – despite all the efforts by the party – he won’t be forgotten.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Zhen',

        title: 'Generation Revolution: New documentary follows journey of London’s young activists of colour',
        subtitle: 'The film gives a rare insight into how activist groups operate in London',
        content: 'Generation Revolution follows two London-based activist groups as they strive to change the capital’s political and social landscape. Through their journey, it tells a sad story - the one of blameless black and brown young people being a potential police target on account of skin colour. The feature-length documentary has recently been released in the UK and it is a brave call to action.\n\nFor more than a year, directors Cassie Quarless and Usayd Younis followed activist groups London Black Revolutionaries (or Black Revs) and R Movement.\n\nThe Black Revs grabbed headlines for pouring concrete over anti-homeless spikes outside a central London Tesco. The radical R Movement took an online debate and turned into a political action.\n\nThe result was a documentary that explores the challenges faced by young activists of colour as they protest against racism, deaths in police custody, migrant policies, attitudes to the homeless and gentrification.\n\n“Young people of colour in the UK a lot of time are represented as violent and apolitical, but we knew that in our community there were people who were doing amazing things and we wanted to capture that”, Cassie Quarless told The Independent.\n\nThrough the activists’ actions and struggles, the audience not only takes a pulse of society’s political and social landscape, but is also given a rare insight into how activist groups operate in London.\n\n“We still have a problem with access to education for black and brown people; we still have problem with over policing; we still have problems with access to healthcare. People are not only aware of these things, but also acting on these things”, the director said.\n\nThe film also takes the viewers right to the heart of some of the main demonstrations that took place in London over the last two years. Black Revs called a “die-in” protest at Westfield shopping centre over Eric Garner’s death, which saw 76 people arrested in 2015 and The Black Lives Matter movement organised a march in Brixton after the killing of black people in the US last July.\n\nAfter a moment of disruption at Black Revs, the activist filmmakers tracked the feelings of some group members as they realised that the nature of peaceful protest is more nuanced and gendered than had at first appeared.\n\nThe film - which is an explicit call to action - was released in the UK last month and has since been well received across the country. Over the past year it also featured in renowned festivals, such as Sheffield Doc/Fest and East End Film Festival.\n\n“We never had a screening where that hasn’t a full Q&A of people always asking questions. There’s never anybody who doesn’t feel the need to explore [the questions raised by the film] more”, said Usayd Younis.\n\nGeneration Revolution can be seen across the UK, with screenings often followed by Q&A sessions with the directors.',

        content: 'Ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām (Arabic: الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام‎ pronounced [æʃˈʃaʕb juˈriːd ʔɪsˈqɑːtˤ ˌænniˈðˤɑːm], "the people want to bring down the regime") is a political slogan associated with the Arab Spring.[1][2] The slogan first emerged during the Tunisian Revolution.[3] The chant echoed at Avenue Habib Bourguiba in Tunis for weeks.[2] The slogan also became used frequently during the 2011 Egyptian revolution.[4][5][6][7] It was the most frequent slogan, both in graffiti and in chants in rallies, during the revolution in Egypt.[8]\n\nThe chant was raised at the protests in Bahrain.[7][9][10] Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam has been used frequently in protests across Yemen.[11][12] The slogan was used in rallies across Libya at the beginning of the 2011 revolt.[13] In March 2011, a group of youths under the age of 15 were arrested in Dera\'a in southern Syria, after having sprayed ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam graffiti. Their arrests sparked the uprising in Syria.[14][15] The slogan was also used frequently in Sudan throughout the protests.[16]\n\nIn Jordan, a youth group named "24 March" used the slogan ash-shaʻb yurīd islah an-niẓām ("the people want to reform the system").[17] However, the slogan later changed to ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam in November 2012, when the government imposed a hike in the price of fuel.[18]\n\nIn Lebanon the slogan has been used in protests against that country\'s sectarian political system.[19] In the Lebanese protests, an-nizam ("the regime") referred to the sectarian political order as such, rather the government.[20] In Palestine, a variation of the slogan, Ash-shaʻb yurīd inhāʼ al-inqisām (الشعب يريد إنهاء الانقسام, "the people want the division to end"), emerged in protests calling for the two main factions Fatah and Hamas to settle their differences.[21] A parody of the slogan has been used by Bashar al-Assad\'s supporters in Syria as ash-shaʻb yurīd Bashār al-Asad (الشعب يريد بشار الاسد "the people want Bashar al-Assad").[22] Another parody of the slogan has been used by King Hamad\'s loyalist in Bahrain as ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ al-Wifāq ("the people want to bring down Al-Wefaq"), referring to the main opposition party of Bahrain, Al-Wefaq.[23]',

        title: 'Palestinian women: a history of female resistance in Gaza and the West Bank',
        subtitle: 'A history of female resistance',
        content: 'Outside observers tend to imagine the face of Gaza as resolutely male: the bearded Hamas “militant”, or the young man hurling stones across the border fence. But Palestinian women, both in Gaza and the West Bank, have a significant presence as activists, protesting against an unjust occupation, but also as the backbone of a fragmented and demoralised society.\n\nWomen have been active in the Palestinian struggle since its early days. In the 1920s, they protested side by side with men against British control of their country. They formed charitable organisations and expressed themselves politically.\n\nAfter the state of Israel was created in 1948, the majority of Palestinians were forced to flee into exile, and here too women played a key role as protectors of their families, and repositories of the “national story”. It was vital that Palestinians, wherever they were in the world, did not forget what had happened and continued to insist on their right of return to their homeland. Women passed their memories of Palestine down to subsequent generations.\n\nParticipating in politics\n\nIn the 1960s, with the emergence of a Palestinian liberation movement, dedicated to regaining the lost homeland, some women turned to more militant activities. Leila Khalid, for example, hijacked several airliners on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and became a familiar face in the Western media.\n\n\nMural of Leila Khaled on a wall in Bethlehem.  Rehgina/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\nGradually, women also started to engage in formal politics, through membership of the main Palestinian political factions. Although Palestinians tend to be socially conservative and are anxious to shield women and girls from what might be considered “dishonourable” or nontraditional behaviour, many younger women found a new kind of freedom through education and political mobilisation.\n\nA largely non-violent intifada (or “uprising”) began in 1987. Women, men and children combined efforts to resist the 20-year occupation of their land. They did so in innovative ways, for example by establishing alternative educational facilities for children after all the schools were closed, creating an alternative economy based on home produce, as well as engaging in large-scale protests.\n\nThere were also attempts at dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli women. For example, in July 2006, members of the International Women’s Commission for a Just and Sustainable Palestinian-Israeli Peace (IWC) convened an emergency meeting in Athens. They urged the international community to intervene. In their words:\n\nCivilians, mainly women and children, are paying the price daily for this vicious cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation. This is a time of great danger … If no action is taken today, tomorrow will be too late.\nAlthough no resolution came out of this or similar calls, initiatives involving women from the two sides were judged to have been among the most promising.\n\nTelling the world\n\nSuch activities ended in 2000, with the start of the second intifada. The resistance was no longer a shared endeavour involving all sectors of society – it was an armed confrontation. Women suffered greatly from rising levels of violence and decreasing security for civilians.\n\nNo one felt safe. Girls travelling from their homes to university were likely to experience harassment at Israeli army checkpoints and, as a result, many parents started to keep their daughters at home, and even to marry them off at the earliest possible opportunity; the age of marriage began to fall.\n\nAs the economic situation deteriorated, women had fewer opportunities for employment. Incidences of mental illness rose and women exhibited deep anxiety about the safety of their children.\n\nMany Palestinians feel that they have no control over their own lives. Under a harsh Israeli regime, it has been very difficult to exercise agency and Palestinian political parties have seemed weak and ineffectual. The Islamist party Hamas seemed to offer a more assertive form of opposition, and many women were attracted by its grassroots organising and evident ability to confront the Israeli occupation. Some became militants.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to argue that the participation of women in violence is a sign of a society that has lost its way, the reality is more complex. Many Palestinian women point out that their community is powerless; it has neither the political leadership nor the weapons to fight a conventional war. Instead, it relies on all its members to participate and “tell the world” what is happening to them.\n\nBy protesting at the Gaza-Israel border to mark the anniversary of al-nakbah (“the catastrophe”), Palestinians are reminding the world that they were dispossessed 70 years ago and this injustice has still not been remedied. Palestinian women, as much as men, have a vital stake in finding a solution to the conflict, that will provide safety and certainty for the next generation.',

        title: 'The 2018 election is going to be a referendum on Hillary Clinton????',
        subtitle: 'Washington (CNN)A new story on Fox News Channel carries this intriguing headline: "Hillary Clinton, not on ballot, is star of GOP midterm plan.',
        content: 'Intriguing!\nHere\'s the key bit:\n"Clinton is starring in the Republican Party\'s 2018 midterm strategy. With no Democrat to attack in the White House for the first time in nearly a decade, Republicans are betting big that the ghost of Clinton will serve them well in 2018.\n"Even if she avoids the spotlight moving forward, the Republican Party plans to evoke her early and often in key congressional races, particularly in regions Trump won, which feature most of the midterm season\'s competitive races."\nAnd, there\'s some evidence to back up the Clinton focus within the GOP. Witness the new ad by Don Blankenship, a Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia.\n"We don\'t need to investigate our president," says the ad\'s narrator. "We need to arrest Hillary."\nIt\'s not clear what Blankenship wants to arrest Clinton for -- email server? Uranium One deal? -- just that he wants to make sure she is incarcerated.\nThere\'s a BIG difference between Republican candidates and committees running ads featuring Clinton and those ads actually working to turn the 2018 midterm election into a referendum on the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.\nThe former could well happen. What special elections since Trump\'s 2016 victory have shown is that the Democratic base is hugely energized -- largely by their dislike for Trump and their disgust with the decisions he has made as president. Meanwhile, the Republican base is fat and happy; their side control the White House, the Senate, the House, the majority of governor\'s mansions and the majority of state legislatures in the country.\nThat sort of disparity in energy between the two party bases is bad news for the side suffering from the passion deficit. Midterm elections tend to be battles between the bases so if one side is much more enthusiastic, it can lead to major seat losses for the other side.\nHow do you motivate the GOP base? You find the equivalent of Donald Trump for the left. The problem, of course, is that there is no equivalent on the right for how the left regards Donald Trump. Trump is president. Hillary Clinton is a private citizen. It\'s just not the same.\nWhich doesn\'t mean, of course, that raising the specter of Clinton in ads won\'t work for some Republican candidates hoping to rev up the base. Republicans loathe Clinton and some -- many -- could have a Pavlovian reaction to the mention of her name and a picture of her on their TV screen. (In a September 2017 CNN national poll conducted by SSRS, 91% of Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Clinton; her overall unfavorable rating was 52%.)\nThe problem with the we-will-make-this-election-all-about-Hillary logic is that it has no logical end. Clinton isn\'t in office. She isn\'t in charge of much of anything. She will not run again for any national office and she likely wouldn\'t win if she did.\nHow, then, do you raise the stakes of voting for a Democrat who is in the same party as Clinton? Like, if, say, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin gets re-elected in West Virginia, is he going to somehow find a way to install Clinton as president or work to enact her agenda? Um, no.\nHistory tells us that midterm elections are always a referendum on the president and his party. Since World War I, there have been only three elections -- 1934, 1998 and 2002 -- in which the president\'s party has not lost seats in a midterm election. In all three of those cases, there was a cataclysmic event that intervened: The Great Depression, Bill Clinton\'s impeachment and the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, respectively.\nShort of something that major happening, the Republican Party is assured of losing seats in the House this fall -- the only question is whether they lose the 23 that would reinstall Democrats to the majority.\nThe reality is that voters make decisions based on the politicians in office, the elected officials who can impact their lives -- often, in their mind, in a negative way. Clinton simply isn\'t that. She is gone from office, never to return. Whether or not she is a visible presence on the campaign trail or fundraising circuit this fall -- my guess is she might do some money raising but isn\'t likely to be a hot commodity on the stump -- won\'t change the fact that she\'s out of office, and staying there.\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, will be president through (at least) 2020.',

        title: 'Cambridge Analytica director \'met Assange to discuss US election\'',
        subtitle: 'Brittany Kaiser also claims to have channelled payments and donations to WikiLeaks',
        content: 'A Cambridge Analytica director apparently visited Julian Assange in February last year and told friends it was to discuss what happened during the US election, the Guardian has learned.\n\nBrittany Kaiser, a director at the firm until earlier this year, also claimed to have channelled cryptocurrency payments and donations to WikiLeaks. This information has been passed to congressional and parliamentary inquiries in the UK and US.\n\nCambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks are already subjects of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, but the revelations open up fresh questions about the precise nature of the organisations’ relationship.\n\nThere was no known connection until October last year, when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had “reached out” to Assange in July 2016 and offered to help him index and distribute the 33,000 emails that had been stolen from Hillary Clinton.\n\nAssange issued a statement saying that he had turned down the Cambridge Analytica offer. Alexander Nix, the company’s chief executive, told Westminster MPs the same in February, during an appearance at the Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee. Nix said he found a contact for WikiLeaks’ speaking agency on the internet and sent Assange an email.\n\nBut visitor logs from the Ecuador embassy obtained by the Guardian and Focus Ecuador appear to show that Brittany Kaiser, a senior executive at Cambridge Analytica until earlier this year, visited Assange on 17 February 2017. Information passed to the DCMS committee in the UK and the Senate judiciary committee in the US states that the meeting was “a retrospective to discuss the US election”.\n\nKaiser is also alleged to have said that she had funnelled money to WikiLeaks in the form of cryptocurrency. She called the organisation her “favourite charity”. The reports passed to investigators say that money was given to her by third parties in the form of “gifts and payments”.\n\nNix is due to appear before the DCMS committee for the second time at 3pm on Wednesday, where he is expected to be pressed on Cambridge Analytica’s relationship with WikiLeaks.\n\nAt his first appearance, Nix told the committee: “We have no relationship with WikiLeaks. We have never spoken to anyone at WikiLeaks. We have never done any business with WikiLeaks. We have no relationship with them, period.”\n\nHe told MPs that Cambridge Analytica had found out about the Clinton emails leak on the news and had “reached out to a speaking agency that represents [Assange] – that was the only way we could find to get hold of him”.\n\nBut when Kaiser appeared before MPs in April, she acknowledged that some employees at the company had contacts with lawyers who had also represented Assange.\n\nDamian Collins, the DCMS committee chair, asked Kaiser: “If Alexander Nix wanted to reach out to Julian Assange, couldn’t he do it through you?” Kaiser replied: “That’s what I was wondering when I found that out from the press – he could have asked me to put him in touch with the legal team. But he didn’t.”\n\nKaiser told MPs that her principal connection to WikiLeaks was via John Jones QC. Jones represented Assange in his extradition case against the Swedish government and became a close, personal friend, visiting him weekly until he was killed by a train in April 2016. The inquest ruled that no-one else was involved in the death of Jones, who had been depressed.\n\nJones’s legal assistant, Robert Murtfeld, who worked closely with him on the WikiLeaks case subsequently went to work for Cambridge Analytica as director of commercial sales in New York. Information passed to the US and UK committees reveals that Murtfield had arranged Kaiser’s visit to Assange last year.\n\nIn a Tweet on Wednesday, Wikileaks said: “WikiLeaks has no knowledge of donations from either party mentioned, did not have a meeting to discuss the US election and was not approached by Murtfeld or anyone connected to him.”\n\nA lawyer for Kaiser acknowledged on Thursday that she visited Assange in February 2017 and said the two discussed “a range of topics including what he had been through in recent years”. Jim Walden, however, denied that they had discussed the 2016 US presidential election.\n\n“I met once with Julian Assange for about 20 minutes in February 2017, long after the US election was over, and listened to his story of what he had experienced in recent years,” Kaiser said in a statement provided to the Guardian.\n\nWalden said Kaiser had made one donation of several hundred dollars to Wikileaks in 2011, in connection to academic research she was doing while studying human rights law at University of London Birkbeck College, for which she used original source documents from Wikileaks.\n\nHe said Kaiser had “never solicited payments” to Wikileaks from third parties.',

        title: 'Assassination in Brazil unmasks the deadly racism of a country that would rather ignore it',
        subtitle: 'In life, Marielle Franco fought against racism in Brazil. Her death put this often-overlooked subject on the front page.',
        content: 'When Marielle Franco, a Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman, was shot to death in downtown Rio on March 14, her killing moved the world.\n\nProtesters took to the streets in New York, Paris, Buenos Aires and elsewhere, pledging to continue Franco’s fight against racism, poverty, inequality and violence.\n\nElected in 2016 after serving 10 years on Rio’s human rights commission, Franco was proud to be a black lesbian born in one of the city’s poor neighborhoods, or favelas. She used her power as an elected official – her “collective mandate,” she called it – to hold Rio’s conservative government accountable to its most marginalized residents.\n\nFranco was particularly critical of the city’s ineffective response to a surge of murders and police shootings in Rio’s mostly black favelas. Local activists have deemed these killings “black genocide.”\n\nAs a black Brazilian lawyer, I can see that Franco’s assassination – a recognized political crime that remains unsolved – has ruptured the dangerous silence surrounding race in this country.\n\nThat seems to be making some powerful people unhappy. On April 9, a Rio city councilman’s aide was also murdered. His boss had recently testified to police in Franco’s murder investigation.\n\nWitnesses say the shooters told 37-year-old Carlos Alexandre Pereira Maria, who is black, that he should “shut his mouth.”\n\n## Brazil’s racist history\nBrazil, where 54 percent of the population is black, has famously portrayed itself as a “racial democracy” – a society so diverse that racism simply cannot exist.\n\nThat’s a myth.\n\nBlack Brazilians earn, on average, 57 percent less than white Brazilians. They make up 64 percent of the prison population. Brazil’s Congress is 71 percent white.\n\n\nRio’s poor favela neighborhoods, where violence is highest, are majority black. Bruno Kelly/Reuters\nRacism here goes back centuries. Brazil was not just a colonial slave empire – it was actually the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, in 1888. Before that, Brazil’s penal code imposed harsh punishment on enslaved people, including execution.\n\nAnd when Afro-Brazilians finally gained legal rights in 1888, the government offered no reparations or financial support after 450 years of bondage.\n\nIn the 1910s, eugenics societies cropped up in São Paulo and Rio. Inspired by racist pseudoscience from the United States and Great Britain, these groups spurred a national movement to “improve the human race” by cleansing Brazil of “undesirable” blood.\n\nBlack people were top among the Brazilians that eugenicists proposed segregating from society, barring from entering the country or deeming “mentally defective.”\n\nThe racist underpinnings of the eugenicist movement would justify discriminatory practices in Brazil for decades to come. Brazil outlawed capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art and dance, until the 1950s. It also made vagrancy illegal, which criminalized homeless and unemployed black people.\n\n## Efforts at equality\nBrazil passed its first anti-discrimination policy in 1951, prohibiting businesses from refusing to serve customers based on race, a typical practice of that era.\n\nFour decades later, in 1989, the black congressman Carlos Alberto de Oliveira pushed through stronger legislation that actually punished discriminatory business practices. It also extended legal protections to people based on ethnicity, religion and national origin.\n\nThe Brazilian government has since made several more attempts to promote racial equality.\n\nA 2010 law aimed at redressing the wrongs of slavery ushered in a mild suite of affirmative actions. Today, Brazilian universities give some priority to black applicants and the government actively recruits black candidates for public sector jobs.\n\nBut racial bias remains potent. A 1988 survey in São Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city, found that 97 percent of respondents said they were not prejudiced. But 98 percent of people said they knew someone who was.\n\nThat impossible finding inspired the historian Lilia Moritz Schwarcz to coin the celebrated saying that, “All Brazilians see themselves as an island of racial democracy surrounded on all sides by racism.”\n\nIn 1995, 89 percent of survey respondents said they believed that racial bias existed in Brazil. Only 10 percent admitted that they held racist views. Results were similar in 2009.\n\n## Lethal racism\nThis is “racismo à brasileira” – racism, Brazil style. Race is still a taboo subject. Nonetheless, as Marielle Franco exposed in her work, skin color dramatically impacts safety in Brazil.\n\nNationwide, 71 percent of the more than 60,000 people murdered in Brazil in 2017 were black, according to the think tank the Brazilian Security Forum.\n\n\nMarielle Franco in 2016.  Mídia NINJA, CC BY-SA\nYoung black men in Rio’s poor favelas are  far more likely to be among the hundreds shot each year by law enforcement. According to a report by Amnesty International, 79 percent of the 1,275 recorded killings by on-duty police officers in Rio between 2010 and 2013 were black.\n\nBlack women also live in a more dangerous world than white women. The number of black Brazilian women murdered increased 54 percent between 2003 and 2013. This happened despite a 2006 anti-domestic violence law credited with a 10 percent reduction in violence against white women.\n\nSo much for “racial democracy.” In purely legal terms, black Brazilians are equal to white Brazilians. But, in real economic, political and criminal justice terms, evidence confirms, they are not.\n\n## Breaking the taboo\nStill, the myth of racial democracy has endured.\n\nA main culprit, in my opinion, is the country’s myopic focus on class. Brazilian policymakers and scholars consistently point to poverty and economic inequality as Brazil’s main social problems.\n\nThe predominant debate on class ignores race, gender and other salient factors that impact life in Brazil. It overlooks the fact that the majority of people facing poverty-related problems like gang violence, food insecurity, unemployment, limited access to education and homelessness are also black.\n\nIn my experience, Brazil’s strong emphasis on economic mobility also contributes to racism. As in the United States, many Brazilians believe that they live in a meritocracy. When black people struggle, white people may well think they just aren’t working hard enough.\n\nBrazil’s conservative current president, Michel Temer, has done little to promote racial equality. Quite the contrary, in fact.\n\nTemer assumed office in 2016 after the controversial impeachment of the left-wing female leader Dilma Rousseff. One of his first acts as president was to shutter Brazil’s Ministry of Women, Racial Equality and Human Rights. Then he appointed an all-white, all-male cabinet.\n\nOn April 6, Temer’s government repealed legislation from the 1990s and 2000s that had recognized and legally protected Afro-Brazilian and indigenous culture and history.\n\nThis, in part, is how Brazilian structures of oppression remain invisible, largely unchallenged and – for white people, at least – easy to ignore.\n\nMarielle Franco talked openly about race, violence and gender. It may be  what got her killed.\n\nBut, in death, Franco’s message of equality has only grown louder.',

        subtitle: 'Earlier this week, the US Supreme Court sided with a religious baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.',
        content: 'Although support was passed by a majority vote, AP News described the decision as limited, meaning that the case won\'t set judicial precedent and act as the blueprint for all cases of religious objections in the future. Other similar appeals are pending.\n\nThe decision is seemingly revelatory of a country which arguably prioritises the right to religion over LGBT+ rights.\n\nNaturally, the ruling has been met with divided opinion online, as well as criticism of the legal defence team. \n\nThe surge in attention has also sparked the reappearance of a hardware store sign which went viral back in 2015, which reads: \'NO GAYS ALLOWED\'.\n\nThe notice hung on the door of an East Tennessee store owned by Jeff Amyx, named Amyx Hardware & Roofing Supplies. When the sign went viral, it was amended to read: \'We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who would violate our rights of freedom of speech & freedom of religion.\' Now, the \'NO GAYS ALLOWED\' sign is back.\n\nIn a recent interview, Amyx claimed the Supreme Court ruling was a victory for Christians, but that "dark days would come".\n\nThis rhetoric echoed through a statement published by USA Today when the initial story broke back in 2015. He explained:\n\nThey gladly stand for what they believe in, why can\'t I? They believe their way is right, I believe it\'s wrong.\n\nBut yet I\'m going to take more persecution than them because I\'m standing for what I believe in.\n\nIt\'s worth pointing out that America\'s First Amendment protects the right to religious freedom, whereas the rights fought for by LGBT+ people are being rescinded at breakneck speed by the Trump administration.\n\nAmyx is also a baptist minister, meaning that his freedom of religion is hardly under threat - according to a 2017 study, Christianity is still the country\'s most common faith. Put simply, Amyx doesn\'t belong to a minority whose rights are being seriously challenged.\n\nThe disproportionate \'persecution\' he speaks of is also impossible to quantify through statistics.\n\nFor example, hate crimes against Christians are comparatively rare, although they do still occur.\n\nOn the other hand, hate crimes motivated by racism, discrimination against minority religions - particularly Islam and Judaism - and, of course, homophobia have continued to rise in frequency over the last few years. In other words, it\'s safe to say Amyx isn\'t the victim here - despite his claims to the contrary.',

        content: 'That’s right, the president who finds time to respond to his many detractors within minutes, at all hours of the day, didn’t so much as send out a tweet acknowledging the LGBT+ community in the month of June.\n\nTrump tweeted a total of 37 times in June 2017, mostly referencing fake news. He mentioned CNN, president Obama and Hillary Clinton in three tweets each. He even made time to tweet "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" twice. In fact, the only time he has mentioned LGBT+ people since becoming president is in reference to his proposed ban on trans people serving in the US military.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump had promised to be different than many of his Republican peers. In June 2016, he even declared that he would be a better ally of the LGBT+ community than Hillary Clinton. He tweeted:\n\nI will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs\n\nBut back in reality, Trump has been described by The Hill as having "taken every opportunity to promote discrimination against LGBT+ people in health care, social services, private business, employment, and state and federally-funded government services under the guise of free exercise of religion".\n\nPresident Bill Clinton first recognised Pride Month, which commemorate the Stonewall Riots of late June 1969, in 1999. He again recognised June as Pride Month in 2000. President Obama consistently recognised Pride Month during his eight years in office and even hosted celebrations inside the White House.\n\nAlthough Trump did not recognise LGBT+ Pride Month in 2017, he proclaimed June as Great Outdoors Month, National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, African-American Music Appreciation Month, National Ocean Month and National Home-ownership Month.\n\nThis year’s Pride Month comes at a time when record numbers of Americans across the political spectrum support same-sex marriage, which was introduced nationwide in 2015. 67 per cent of Americans now support same-sex unions, up five per cent from 2017.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump will recognise LGBT+ Pride Month 2018, but it doesn\'t look likely.\n\nHappy Great Outdoors Month, though.',

        title: 'The Olympics Have Left Sochi, but Don’t Forget LGBT Russians',
        subtitle: 'People sing the Russian national anthem while raising rainbow flags and a Russian flag in solidarity with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community of Russia, as part of a film project called "Live and Let Love", at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium October 6, 2013. ©2013 Reuters Erik Martensson/TT News Agency',
        content: 'In June 2013, just months before the opening ceremony of the Sochi Olympics, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed what became known as the “gay propaganda law,” arguing that “nontraditional sexual relations” were a danger to children, the family and society. The law, Putin claimed, would uphold “traditional values.”\n\nOn paper and compared to a spectrum of anti-gay laws in some other countries, this new law was not the worst. It made the sharing of “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships” an administrative, not criminal, offense, punishable with a fine, not imprisonment. But its most harmful effects are insidious. It effectively excluded a vulnerable minority from full participation in society and gave state sanction to their status as outsiders.\n\nThe well-founded fear of activists in Russia was that the law would not only restrict freedom of expression, but would send a message that the government condoned homophobia, leaving gay people vulnerable to violence and abuse.\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\n\nThe passage of the law coincided with a ratcheting up of homophobic rhetoric in state media and a dramatic increase in attacks by vigilante groups and individuals. Vigilantes preyed on young gay men, lured them via dating apps to fake rendezvous, and beat, humiliated and tortured them. The attackers filmed these attacks, and posted the footage on social media, including images of themselves attacking the men they perceived as gay, confident in their impunity. As expected, the police failed to recognize the attacks as hate crimes.\n\nIn passing the law though, the Russian Duma did not seem to anticipate the uproar that became the most enduring image of the Sochi games. Protests took place in cities across the globe and, under pressure, the International Olympic Committee said it was open to expressly forbidding discrimination on grounds of “sexual orientation” in the Olympic charter, which it subsequently did. Media coverage of the games put an enormous spotlight on LGBT Russians, with some going so far as to call the games the “gay Olympics.” Putin’s moment of anticipated glory, for him and for Russia, was clouded by the outcry against this law.\n\nIndeed, the passage of the law sparked more international outrage than other serious human rights violations committed during preparations for other Olympics, including abuse against migrant workers, local residents, and protesters.\n\nBut despite the furor, the facts on the ground for LGBT Russians were not changed. The four years since Sochi have been marked by discrimination and brutal anti-gay violence, and while the focus of the international media has long ago moved on, Putin’s “traditional values” continue to do immeasurable damage.\n\nFor the Kremlin the law was classic political homophobia – a way of consolidating their conservative support base in Russia and, internationally, to forge an anti-Western alliance under the rubric of “traditional values.” This has been an effective and damaging strategy, that seeks to undermine the universality of rights, by suggesting that rights are subordinate to cultural norms, and subjective moral values. In Russia’s attack on human rights norms, LGBT people are a lightning rod ― portrayed as the antithesis of morality and culture. \n\nThe propaganda law also provided some of the rhetorical justification and presumed political cover for a violent anti-gay purge in Russia’s Chechen Republic that took place last year. Police and security officials rounded up men presumed to be gay, tortured them in informal facilities, mined their social media accounts for the names of others, and detained them. Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been ruling Chechnya through brutal repression with the Kremlin’s blessing, fluctuated between denying there were any gay people in Chechnya, and justifying the purge as a social cleansing ritual. Through public rituals of humiliation in front of senior male relatives, the purge symbolically and violently reasserted notions of traditional masculinity in Chechnya. The level of brutality, and the direct involvement of high ranking officials, was chilling.\n\nOne victim recalled being hauled before male relatives: “[Officials] shout abuse at you, call you names, the most offensive names, and they order you to step forward, admit it to your relatives, admit that you’re gay.” Detainees were then released to elder male relatives, and their captors encouraged families to commit so-called “honor killings.”\n\nCommenting on his childhood socialization, Kadyrov, who projects his own version of strongman masculinity, said:  “This is how they teach us from childhood. My father told me when I was a little boy, ‘If you’re coming home because you got scared, don’t come home. I have no need for you. You’re not a girl, you’re a man.’”\n\nSustained international pressure ultimately compelled the Kremlin to ensure the suspension of the purge by Chechen authorities and open a federal inquest. That inquest has been a non-starter, but the crimes have not gone completely unheeded. Both Kadyrov and Ayub Kataev, an official in the Chechen Internal Affairs Ministry who allegedly operated one of the unlawful detention facilities, were sanctioned under the United States government’s Magnitsky Act, which allows the executive branch to impose visa bans and targeted sanctions on individuals in Russia responsible for human rights violations.\n\nBut for men caught up in the purge, their lives have been shattered. Some were fortunate enough to escape to bigger metropolitan centers in Russia, and from there some were resettled in other countries. As of October, Russia’s leading LGBT support group saidthey had helped evacuate at least 79 people affected by the purge.\n\nIn 2017, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the “gay propaganda” law and ordered the government to pay restitution to three plaintiffs ― a decision that Russia is obligated by treaty to respect ― but Russian courts continue to punish people under the law. At least seven people have been convicted in the last year alone, including for years-old Facebook posts.\n\nHowever, a recent video sensation showed that ordinary Russians value their freedom to laugh over so-called “traditional values.” In January, footage of freshmen air transport cadets performing a homoerotic parody to the song ”Satisfaction” went viral and caused a scandal in Russia. When participants were threatened with disciplinary action, other groups – including construction workers, agricultural students and stable hands ― made similar campy, parody videos in support. In the face of these viral acts of solidarity poking fun at the hallmarks of hegemonic masculinity, authorities backed down, and the cadets will not be charged.\n\nThis protest, like those around the Sochi Olympics, showed the Russian government is not immune to pressure. But absent permanent reform, the propaganda law remains a tool for repression. And it’s the obligation of the international community to not let that stand.\n\nThe Olympics may have moved on, but LGBT Russians don’t have that luxury.',

        title: 'Carson Block Bets That a Nasdaq-Listed Chinese Internet Stock Is a ‘Fraud’',
        subtitle: '"This thing is a complete fraud, a total zero," Block tells Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker.',
        content: 'Prominent short seller Carson Block said he’s now targeting China Internet Nationwide Financial Services Inc., a Nasdaq-listed stock that went public in July.\n\nThe chief investment officer of Muddy Waters Capital called the Beijing-based company “a fraud” in a report Wednesday. While China Internet Nationwide Financial Services says it makes money from lending, Block said almost none of its business is real and the only person taking out loans is the chairman, Jianxin Lin.\n\n“Just in the name, the only thing accurate is China,” Block said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “There is nothing internet about it, there is nothing nationwide about it, and from our vantage point, it is a fraud and a total zero.”\n\nThe stock briefly declined on Block’s comments, then pared losses to trade 0.6 percent lower at $38.08 as of 12:12 p.m. in New York. Shares have been on a volatile ride since debuting at $10, reaching as high as $61 last month. The company’s market capitalization is now about $840 million.\n\nBlock called the company “worthless,” adding that financial statements it submitted to China’s State Administration For Industry and Commerce showed it overstated revenue in filings with U.S. regulators. Block also said that loans the company makes are to “sham counterparties controlled by the chairman and his friends.”\n\nThe Chinese company rejected Block’s comments in a short blogpost late Thursday, saying Muddy Waters had hurt its reputation and market performance. It planned to hire a law firm to investigate, the firm said on its official account on Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like service.\n\nShort sellers like Muddy Waters make bets against companies, benefiting when their share price falls. Block rose to fame wagering against Chinese companies and publishing detailed reports on his reasoning. One of his past targets was Sino-Forest Corp., a forestry company, which lost more than two-thirds of its market value in two days after Block first criticized it in 2011, and was subsequently delisted.\n\nA QuickTake on short-selling\n\nOther targets have emerged relatively unscathed. Shares of Bank of the Ozarks are slightly higher after Block advised taking a short position on the company May 4. Man Wah Holdings Ltd. is up 17 percent since Block said June 7 he was betting on declines.\n\nIn the interview Wednesday, Block also accused major U.S. exchanges of shirking their duty to police markets and keep scams away from the investing public. A representative for Nasdaq didn’t immediately return a request for comment.\n\n“When I see exchanges open the doors wide to total scams like CIFS, I think that’s un-American,” Block said, referring to a remark made about short-selling earlier in the year by NYSE President Tom Farley.\n\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc., which both collect fees from their listed companies, have advocated looser regulations to make it easier to go public. At a hearing with members of Congress in July, Farley said that it’s become too difficult for small companies to raise money. Farley said that companies face undue hurdles complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law passed in the wake of the Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. accounting scandals to ensure corporations give truthful accounts of their finances. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman expressed a similar sentiment in a Nasdaq whitepaper this year, which argued that the U.S. should reform regulations to make markets friendlier to IPOs.\n\n— With assistance by Kana Nishizawa',

        title: 'The Great Bitcoin Scam',
        subtitle: 'I cover Wealth Preservation in its legal permutations\n\n--Jay Adkisson ,CONTRIBUTOR',
        content: 'At the outset, let me clarify that Bitcoin itself is not a scam, but how Bitcoin is being sold is a scam. More about that below.\n\nTo start out, it is important to understand what Bitcoin really is. It would be easy to bore you with a discussion of the technology, about peer-to-peer servers and sophisticated algorithms, but that is not what you need to know.\n\nWhat you need to know about Bitcoin is that distilled to its technological essence, each Bitcoin is simply a number. That\'s it: A number. It is simply a series of digits, with each number being assigned to each Bitcoin.\n\nTo illustrate, I\'ll randomly pull a $1 bill from my wallet, which bears No. L88793293J. Assuming some minimal level of competency by the U.S. Treasury, no other bill bears that number.\n\nThe face value of a $1 bill is, of course, just $1 dollar. It is simply a unit of exchange, printed on what many folks would consider to be ugly paper.\n\n\nBut two people could privately agree that No. L88793293J is actually worth $5,000. To illustrate Fred wants to buy Joe\'s golf clubs, but Fred doesn\'t want his wife to know -- at least just yet -- that he spent $5,000 for golf clubs. So, Fred and Joe agree that No. L88793293J is worth $5,000 and Fred gives No. L88793293J to Joe. Fred then tells his wife that he bought the clubs for the $1 bill. At some later time, when Fred\'s wife doesn\'t care so much, Fred pays $5,000 to Joe for No. L88793293J, and gets the $1 bill back.\n\nThe only difference between Bitcoin No. ABC123 and $1 Bill No. L88793293J is that at the end of the day, the $1 bill physically exists and has a face value that is worth something, i.e., Fred could take the $1 bill and buy something off the $1 menu at McDonalds.\n\n\nJay Adkisson\nThe Bitcoin Bubble\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value -- it is just a number. The number may have an agreed value between two parties, but the number itself has no value. Consider a bank account number, such as Wells Fargo Account No. 456789. The depositor and Wells Fargo essentially agree that the account designated by No. 456789 has the value of what the depositor puts into it, less what the depositor takes out. But the number itself, No. 456789 has no value. The same situation occurs with credit card transactions, whereby the credit card processing company assigns are unique value to each transaction, but the number itself has no value.\n\nHere, the technological difference with cybercurrencies, or crypocurrencies if you prefer, is that they don\'t require a middleman such a clearing bank. Value, whatever it is, goes directly from A to B, with nobody in the middle. That has some value, but how much? The value, it would seem, would be the difference in the cost of the wire-transfer fees less transaction cost of the cybercurrency unit, which isn\'t that much -- and in some cases, the wire-transfer could actually be less expensive, although more cumbersome.\n\nSo, if you find the idea of thinking of Bitcoin as simply a number is too simplistic, then just think of it as a money bag with a lock, the internet version of this. Money goes from transmittor to transmittee, and the transmittee gets a unique code to unlock the bag. What\'s that really worth?',

        title: 'How Chinese People View the US-China Trade War',
        subtitle: 'What public opinion in China says about the trade frictions (and what that means for the United States).',
        content: 'Close observers can glean clues about Chinese government policy based on the degree of censorship on discussions of certain topics. For example, I have been following the North Korean issue closely. After the conclusion of the annual sessions of the National People’s Congress and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference on March 20, many articles related to North Korea on my WeChat public account were deleted by the network management department, even including those posted back in 2015. At that moment, I predicted that there would soon be some changes in Chinese policy toward North Korea because I criticized North Korea in many of my articles. It turned out that Kim Jong-un visited Beijing shortly after that.\n\nRecently, there are more and more articles about the China-U.S. “trade war” on WeChat public accounts and they are rarely deleted. Since most of these articles criticize the United States and President Donald Trump, I reached the following conclusions: 1) China is definitely using public opinion to put pressure on the U.S. government; 2) Xi Jinping’s firm hand against Trump’s threat of a “trade war” is authentic; and 3) Trump should take Xi’s stance seriously.\n\nIn fact, I don’t think there will be a trade war between the United States and China since they are the world’s largest and second largest economies. The value of their bilateral trade equals the GDP of many countries. The economic damage of a China-U.S. trade war could be comparable to that of a real war. No rational politician would agree to it — but that, of course, requires accepting the premise that Trump could be rational.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\nScholars and journalists also generally take a calm view toward a China-U.S. trade war. They think the announced tariffs are a form of game playing between China and the United States, just like their back-and-forth  on other issues like Taiwan and North Korea. After all, Sino-U.S. relations are multidimensional and economic frictions and political frictions coexist, which is understandable.\n\nWhat’s critical is that it seems the Sino-U.S. economic communication mechanism in the Trump era is not as smooth as it used to be. There are even problems with some high-level interactions and economic dialogues. Chinese academics cite, as an example of this, that Liu He, Xi’s close aide and a vice premier of the State Council, didn’t meet with Trump in person during his visit to the United States, which was considered a bad sign for Sino-U.S. relations. In brief, what’s frightening is not the existence of misunderstanding but the lack of a comprehensive and mature exchange mechanism to address issues.\n\nBut what do ordinary Chinese people think? This question should be considered from two perspectives. Most people are closely following the developments, and gained both national pride and confidence from the counterattack launched by the Chinese government against Trump. Some people, though, think that China may have no advantages in a trade war and will suffer bigger losses, because there is a significant quantitative difference between products imported by China from the United States and the products imported by the U.S. from China. Some netizens point out that China could sell a large number of U.S. Treasury securities as a counterattack against a trade war, but China wouldn’t benefit much from doing so.\n\nThere are even some people who think that from a personal standpoint it might not be a bad thing if the United States could pressure China economically, because it might make China more open and, for example, make it much more convenient and cheaper for Chinese people to buy imported cars.\n\nIn his speech at the Boao Forum for Asia recently, Xi referred to China’s plan to become more open in the finance, insurance, and automobile sectors, among others. Many saw this as a response to Trump’s threat. One conclusion thus has gained traction among Chinese: this is a concession on the part of China’s government to the United States, which means that it is effective for Trump to pressure China using economic means.\n\nOne interesting aspect of this debate is the stance of relatively radical Chinese people. This group argues that, as the United States has always been tough on China over the years, China should take this trade war as an opportunity to teach the United States a lesson in order to make the United States more polite when dealing with China in the future. “Since Trump is the president they [the Americans] elected, they should pay for it,” such posts often argue.\n\nPeople who embrace this view have seesawed back and forth along with Trump’s mood changes. For example, Trump tweeted on April 8 that he and Xi would always be friends and that the Sino-U.S. trade conflicts would be solved, which was interpreted and celebrated by many as a concession made by Trump to China. On the next day, however, Trump tweeted about China’s unfair 25 percent tariffs on car imports from the United States and called on China to put a full stop to it. So the same people angrily called Trump a lunatic who is reckless, thoughtless, and dangerous to China.\n\nThe fact that Trump frequently tweets about China has been a hot topic among Chinese people. His tweets never fail to cause a big stir among the public. Some believe that he is good at putting up smokescreens to confuse Chinese people and leaders. There have also been calls for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find an appropriate way to offset Trump’s preemptive strategy of diplomacy, since passive responses might not be enough to adapt to the new situation.\n\nEver since Trump started the trade war, the United States has also taken many provocative steps on the Taiwan issue as well, infuriating Chinese people and increasing their deep concerns over Trump’s real goal behind the trade war. More and more people believe that the United States is trying to “contain” China through political, economic, and military means, and think China should make big adjustments to Sino-U.S. relations as a result.',

By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions.\n\nSpoofing is a criminal offense under a provision implemented as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform.\n\nSome of the manipulative behavior came to light as a result of the authorities\' previously-settled probes into forex market manipulation while UBS self-reported the wrongdoing, according to two of the people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe bank investigations have been ongoing for more than a year, one of the people said.\n\nThe settlement is the most high-profile brought so far by the CFTC\'s head of enforcement James McDonald who was appointed to the role in March 2017.\n\nBuffett\'s investing basics.
